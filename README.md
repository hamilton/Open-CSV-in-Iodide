# Open CSV in Iodide ðŸ¤ 

__proof of concept, y'all__

Right click on a csv or on a page that loaded a csv and find the menu item.

[Download the xpi here](https://github.com/hamilton/Open-CSV-in-Iodide/raw/master/web-ext-artifacts/open_in_iodide-0.1-an%2Bfx.xpi). It's probably going to change a lot. Right now, it doesn't really detect what is a csv and what isn't.
