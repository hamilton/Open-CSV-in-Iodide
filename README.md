Right click on a csv or on a page that loaded a csv and find the menu item.

[Download the xpi here](https://github.com/hamilton/Open-CSV-in-Iodide/raw/master/web-ext-artifacts/open_in_iodide-0.1-an%2Bfx.xpi). It's probably going to change a bit. For now, I've opted for the least-good version of it.

Two examples:
- _open a csv link_ --- Go to this [Washington Post Github data repository](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings) and find the link in the readme. Right click, and select the "Open CSV in Iodide" menu item.
- _right-click on a csv page somewhere_ --- Go to this [CSV of Bob Ross episodes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/bob-ross/elements-by-episode.csv) and right-click on the page, then click on "Open CSV in Iodide".

In both of the above examples, you should be directed to a template Iodide notebook with a bunch of code pre-populated. Click the "run all cells" (fast-forward) in the top left to pull the data. Now, go wild!
